# Introduction:
A Students' Academic Performance Dataset is an educational data set which is 
collected from a learning management system (LMS). Such a system provides users 
with synchronous access to educational resources from any device with an Internet
connection. In our project, we have visualized the dataset in order to facilitate the 
extraction of information that helps in deducing results that may contribute to the 
development of education.

# Exploratory Data Analysis:
Here we will show several of the plots that we made using the matplotlib and 
seaborn libraries. Which are two of the libraries used in the Python programming
language to do data visualization.

## Conclusion
In this project, we've gone over several ways to plot a distribution plot using 
Seaborn and matplotlib with Python programming language
